The goal of this project is to design a low-cost, low-power device capable of solving the angle of arrival 
(AoA) problem on continuous audio.  The AoA problem takes considerable computational effort, but the 
goal in this project is to use a very resource constrained device to solve this problem with limited 
computational capabilities.  Solutions of the AoA problem have applications for a robot to determine the 
direction of a speaker.  A DMA acquisition system with feature detection and correlation-based time 
difference of arrival calculations will be used on this project.
